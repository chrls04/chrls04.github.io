                <h4>Fashion</h4>
                <p>Clothes aren't just clothes, they're my mood, my energy, my personality. For me, everyday is an opportunity to experiment with new fits.
                Whether it's scrounging through thrift stores for hours looking for hidden gems, or
                going down the rabbit hole of online shopping, I'm here for it all. <br><br>
                Just don't as me how much time I've spent scrolling through outfit inspo instead of stuyding.

                <h4>Bubble Tea</h4>
                <p>Unfortunately, I have a crippling bubble tea addiction, and my bank account absolutely hates me for it. 
                    It's not just a drink, it's a lifestyle.
                    On a normal day, I typically order a classic pearl milk tea, but honestly, I'll drink anything as long as the menu says it's bubble tea.

            <div class="description">
                <h4>Walks / Hikes</h4>
                <p>You might not believe me when I say this, but long walks are like therapy to me. 
                    If I manage to bait a friend to join me, I'll rip through 40k steps in a day, light work.
                    Add some good conversation, some scenery, and bubble tea at the end, and even hikes don't got anything against me.

            <div class="description">
                <h4>Dogs</h4>
                <p>I'm a dog person, no question about it. If theres a fluffier, bubblier, and more cloud-like creature than a Samoyed, I haven't heard of them.
                    If i'm not dreaming of cuddling one, I'm probably rotting away on my bed while scrolling through videos of them on Instagram. <br> <br>
                    Dogs > Cats.
